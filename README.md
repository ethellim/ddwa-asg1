# DDWA Assignment 1

My PHP-based Content Management System with careful considerations to database design.
It is catered for 3 different types of users: Administrator, Staff and Student.

## Design Process

This website is made for my Content Management System.
The index page serves as an introduction to my system where users can read up what service IRL provides.

As an administrator type, I want to purchase new software titles, upgrade existing softwares to newer versions and remove softwares that are no longer in use.

As a staff type, I want to oversee what projects I am supervising and keep track of the number of hours spent on each project.

As a student type, I want to know what my project is and if there are any other students assigned with me.
